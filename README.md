# {Ionia Tale}

## Description

{This is a University class project of game design. We have to build a platformer ortografic game. We have created one of our own style inspired in the world of League of Legends, Runaterra. Its the story of a young Yasuo that goes through an adventure to tame the wind. He begins in the village and has to traverse the levels and arrive to the wind cave. We have developed the first level (a forest), and we want to make another (flying islands) where the cave will be located. The player can run, jump, die and charge the magic of nature. It's a c++ Project developed on Visual Studio. The map has been made on Tiled and the data is managed with xml. The physics engine is Box2d.}
